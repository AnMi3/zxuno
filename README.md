# Z80 Assembler MOOC
 
A Massive Online Open Course on Z80 Assembly Language for 8bit computers. 

This course is thought to teach people how to program in Z80 assembly language in a funny way. The course will be guided by practical exercises, instead of theory. Theoretical videos will also be created, but they will be accessed through links on practical videos. The idea is to let students reach theory as they need it: otherwise, theory is not perceived as useful until practical problems arise. Therefore, theory is not learnt well, and is often not funny. This course will try to overcome this problem.

Original intention is to create a course for everyone wanting to learn Assembler, even if they have not programmed before. Therefore, course content should be modularized to let attendants follow their own path, depending on their skills and desires. In fact, this course should be useful as a primer in computer programming, in order to let attendants develop low-level machine knowledge and skills. This knowledge and skills will be their basis to become really good programmers in their future.
